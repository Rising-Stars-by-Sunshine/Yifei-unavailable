## Background/Motivation 
The digital economy is particularly impacted by the strategic interactions between existing firms and potential entrants, known as the "entry deterrence game." In traditional economic models, incumbent firms may employ strategies to prevent market entry by new competitors, which can lead to suboptimal market outcomes and inefficiencies. Current literature lacks a comprehensive approach on leveraging AI to enhance the efficiency of these interactions, making it a critical gap as AI's role in decision-making and strategic planning continues to grow. Understanding and improving the efficiency of entry deterrence games is crucial because it can lead to more competitive markets, lower prices, and greater innovation, significantly affecting economic and market dynamics.

## Research Questions
1.How can AI be integrated into game theory models to enhance the efficiency of entry deterrence strategies?
2.What impact would such AI-enhanced strategies have on market competition and economic welfare?
3.Why have traditional game theory approaches not yet incorporated AI in modeling entry deterrence strategies?

## Application Scenario
My research specifically applies to industries with high barriers to entry, where incumbents might employ strategic actions to deter entry, such as in the telecommunications or pharmaceutical sectors. The foundation of AI-driven models could be significantly informed by behavioral psychology, which examines decision-making under uncertainty and competitive environments, thereby accurately reflecting realistic human and AI strategic interactions.
## Methodology
I am adapting traditional game theory models to include AI-driven decision processes, focusing on entry deterrence. By utilizing agent-based modeling, I simulate environments where AI agents act as either incumbents or entrants to explore various strategic interactions and their outcomes. Additionally, machine learning algorithms are employed to predict and enhance the efficiency of these strategies, aiming to identify approaches that lead to a more equitable and dynamic market.
## Preliminary Results
An illustrative example from my work involves a simulated market scenario where AI enhances the decision-making processes of an incumbent firm. This simulation shows how AI integration can soften aggressive deterrent strategies, potentially lowering entry barriers and fostering a more vibrant market environment. Such improvements in market dynamics illustrate the potential for enhanced consumer welfare and market efficiency, challenging existing models that do not incorporate AI.
## Intellectual Merits and Practical Impacts
One limitation of my current research is its focus on specific market contexts, which may not generalize across all strategic environments. Future research could extend these AI-enhanced game theory models to other strategic contexts, such as price wars or patent races. The practical implications of my work could significantly influence how businesses strategize against potential competitors and how regulators design policies to encourage fair competition, thereby improving market efficiency and economic welfare across various industries.
