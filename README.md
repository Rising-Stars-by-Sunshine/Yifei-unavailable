## About Me
My name is Yifei Wang, and I'm currently a senior student specializing in Political Economy, with a focus on the Economics track. While my background in Computer Science may not be as extensive as many of yours, I possess a strong enthusiasm for learning and am keen to gain insights from your experiences. Football is a passion of mine, and I had the privilege of being part of the DKU varsity football team. I'm looking forward to engaging with all of you!
